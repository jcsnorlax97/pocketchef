		<h2>Postmortem</h2>
		<p>
			Our development of PocketChef was that of biting off more than we could chew. For every
			iteration of our project, we constantly overestimated the amount of work that we would be
			to do. This meant that we would have to push stuff back to other iterations. This made it
			difficult for us because we fell behind on what we wanted to accomplish. We had to choose
			what features we wanted to keep and what we had to push back or get rid of all together.
			We didn't really have issues with any part of our program, however the database took much
			longer than we expected it to. Justin and Beni worked very hard on implementing it and they
			seem happy with what they got done. We finished most of the UI stuff in iteration 1 so that
			never really popped up again which was nice; we could just focus on the actual function
			of the app. John worked on the search functionality and the UI regarding the search for most
			of the project. Each iteration adding 1 more feature and making it work with the database as
			it evolved. Derek worked on displaying a recipe once it has been searched along with helping
			out with the overall design of the app. Jas worked on the settings page and the homepage of
			the app.
		</p>
		<p>
			Another thing that we constantly struggled with is procrastination. While we tried to schedule
			meetings and set early deadlines, we just were unable to follow through on them. Whether there
			was no time that worked to meet, or as discussed above, we overestimated the amount of work we
			thought we could do; the last 3 days before the assignment due date were always filled with
			chaos.
		</p>
		<p>
			I think if we had the chance to redo this assignment the thing that we change the most is setting
			HARD deadlines, and early deadlines. We caused ourselves a lot of unnecessary stress trying to
			panic finish the iteration.
			The thing that took the most time was, by far, absolutely the database. This was new territory
			for the people that worked on it and it took a long time. Spanning about 1.5 iterations and around
			3000 lines of code we have a persistent working database that holds our recipes. The thing that took
			the least amount of time (at least compared to what we thought it would take) is searching through
			the ingredients of a recipe. A large part of why we chose to make this app was because we wanted to
			do something unique and we had never heard of an app that allows you to find a recipe based on an
			ingredient. We though that searching the database in this way would take a long time to figure out,
			not to mention that the database had to be setup to be able to be searched in this way. In the end
			it was actually fairly easy and straight forward to do, which was a huge surprise and a blessing
			since we had many other things to do as well.
			We agree that the project turned out fairly well, and similar to what we had envisioned at the
			beginning. While we didn't get individual accounts/profiles implemented this was a minor part
			of what we were looking forwards to. We are pleased with what we did, we have a working app that
			could actually (and I think some people are planning on) be used in daily life. With a couple more
			months we could add some more features, like automatically parsing and adding a recipe from a website
			to the app. This would make the app a lot more desirable to use since it is time consuming to add
			multiple recipes.
		</p>
		<p>
			This iterations retrospective would not have been very different from the others that we did. We
			procrastinated which caused us a bunch of extra stress. So even though we tried to have a goal that
			we would meet regularly and finish early that has not happened.
