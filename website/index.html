		<h2>Project Overview</h2>

		<h3>Vision statement:</h3>
		<p>
			PocketChef is an easy, fun application that will be an everyday lifestyle tool
			used to help people find recipes that they can make with the ingredients they
			have at home.
		</p>

		<h3>Intended Users:</h3>
		<p>
			The demographic for this app is aimed for users like parents looking to try out
			some new, tasty dishes, or students away from home that need extra inspiration
			to decide on what they want. PocketChef can also be used by athletes trying to
			find health-orientated meals, or individuals dying to have an authentic Italian
			meal. Overall, PocketChef will be used by just about anyone looking for some
			extra help in the kitchen.
		</p>

		<h3>Functionality:</h3>
		<p>
			The app allows a user to store recipes to their phone/tablet so that they can later
			recall them. This means that they are able to add them to a local database and then
			later recall them using a search. The user is able to search through their recipes
			by name, category type or ingredients.
		</p>

		<h3>Why PocketChef?</h3>
		<p>
			PocketChef is the only app known to be able to search through recipe
			ingredients, in addition to the standard searching of recipe names and category types.

		<p>Note: Beni (who did the recording) crashed 2 or 3 times trying to get the Android Studio Emulator recording working. So we decided to do this instead, we know its not what was asked but what was asked didn't work. Plus we are very happy with how it turned out, so enjoy.</p>
