**PocketChef**
==============
A phone recipe application

Vision Statement
----------------
PocketChef is an easy, fun application that will be an everyday lifestyle tool 
used to help people find recipes that they can make with the ingredients they 
have at home. 

Everybody has to eat, so why not eat delicious food. PocketChef stores a 
collection of recipes that a client can look up, and use. The recipes can be 
searched through individually in order to find a specific dish, for example 
fish tacos. As well it allows recipes to be filtered by category such as Mexican
or Italian. More importantly, the app allows people to search through recipes 
by specific ingredients. For example, if someone has tortillas and green 
peppers, they can enter this into the app, and it will show them all types of 
recipes with those ingredients such as soft tacos, quesadillas, wraps, burritos 
and more. If they are in the mood for something with cinnamon they can enter 
cinnamon and get results for mouth watering cinnamon buns, crispy French toast
or pancakes. This makes PocketChef unique, due to the fact that no other 
well-known app has the capability to filter by ingredient. 

The demographic for this app is aimed for users like parents looking to try out
some new, tasty dishes, or students away from home that need extra inspiration
to decide on what they want. PocketChef can also be used by athletes trying to 
find health-orientated meals, or individuals dying to have an authentic Italian 
meal. Overall, PocketChef will be used by just about anyone looking for some
extra help in the kitchen.

Every single day, people make the same old dishes while letting older unused 
ingredients in their fridge go to waste just because they don’t know what they
can make with it. PocketChef is a solution to these problems. Being able to
search by categories or filter by ingredient will assist everyday people to
think outside the box on what they can make at home. PocketChef will be a
valuable app to its clients because there is no recipe app known to the mass
public that has the ability to filter recipes by ingredients. This can be a
solution to the vast majority of people who suffer from the problem of not
knowing what they can make with the ingredients already in their fridge.

This application will be considered a success based on two main criteria.
First, its predicted that for this application to be successful, it must be
able to successfully filter recipes by ingredients effectively. Secondly, after
some use by the consumers, they will be asked to compare PocketChef to other
popular recipe applications currently on the market. If a statistically
significant percent of consumers prefers PocketChef over the competitions, as
well as the first criteria succeeding, then the application will overall be 
considered a success.
