**PocketChef**
==============
A phone recipe application

Vision Statement
----------------
PocketChef is an easy, fun app that will be an everyday lifestyle tool 
used to help people find recipes that they can make with the ingredients they 
have at home. 

Everybody has to eat, so why not eat delicious food. PocketChef 
stores a collection of recipes that a client can use to look up previously 
inputted recipes. The recipes can be searched individually for a specific dish, 
for example, fish tacos. As well it allows recipes to be searched by category 
such as Mexican or Italian. More importantly, the app allows people to search 
through recipes by specific ingredients.For example,  if you have tortilla and 
green peppers, you can enter this into the app and it will show you all types 
of recipes with those ingredients, such as soft tacos, quesadillas, wraps, burrito 
and more. Or if your in the mood for something with cinnamon you can enter cinnamon 
and get results for mouth watering cinnamon buns, crispy French toast or pancakes. 
This makes Pocket Chef unique, due to the fact that no other well-known app has 
this type of feature in use. This will help it stand out to  so many people 
interested in finding recipes for food. The demographic for this app is aimed for 
users like parents looking to try out some new, tasty dishes, or students away 
from home that need extra inspiration to decideon what they want. PocketChef 
can also be used by athletes trying to find health-orientated meals, or 
individuals dying to have an authentic Italian meal. However, overall PocketChef 
will be used by just about anyone looking for some extra help in the kitchen. 


People every single day make the same old dishes as they usually have, while 
letting older unused ingredients in their fridge go to waste, because they just 
don’t know what they can make with it. Pocket Chef is a solution to these problems. 
Beingable to search by categories, or filter by ingredient will assist everyday 
people to think outside the box on what to they can make at home. Overall, what 
makes PocketChef so valuable is the fact that there is no recipe app known to 
the mass public that has the ability to filter recipes by ingredients. This can 
be a solution to somany people’s problems of not knowing what they can make with 
the ingredients already in their fridge.

This application will be considered a 
success based on two main criteria. First, its predicted that for this app to 
be successful, it must be able to successfully filter recipes by ingredients 
effectively.  Secondly, after some use by the consumers, theywill be asked to 
compare our app to other popular recipe apps currently on the market. If a 50% 
share of consumers prefer Pocket Chef over the competitions, as well as the first 
criteria succeeding, than the application will overall be considered a success.
